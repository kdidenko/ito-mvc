Neuro refers to the brain and nervous system, all of which is powered by sensory in-put-what we see, hear, feel, smell, and taste. Linguistic refers to language, or the packaging of our thoughts.

Thus people say one talks to oneself (the auditory sense) even if no words are emitted, one makes pictures in one''s head when thinking or dreaming (the visual sense), and one considers feelings in the body and emotions (known as the kinesthetic sense).</p>\r\n<p>NLP holds it as crucial in human cognitive processing to recognize that the subjective character of experience is strongly tied into, and influenced by, how memories and perceptions are processed within each sensory representation in the mind. It considers that expressions such as "It''s all misty" or "I can''t get a grip on it", can often be precise literal unconscious descriptions from within those sensory systems, communicating unconsciously where the mind perceives a problem in handling some mental event.</p>\r\n<p>Within NLP, the various senses in their role as information processors, are known as representation systems, or sensory modalities.
